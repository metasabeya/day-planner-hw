# Day-Planner using jquery
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule


WHEN I open the planner

THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

WHEN I scroll down

THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours

WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day

THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

WHEN I click into a timeblock

THEN I can enter an event

WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock

THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage

WHEN I refresh the page

THEN the saved events persist
the challenging thing here is to put such function for the time interval(past,present,future)
this is how it looks like.
